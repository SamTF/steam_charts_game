A **Discord Bot game** where you have to guess which Steam game has the most concurrent players at the moment.

## Main features
- Very simple and intuitive
- The bot randomly selects two Steam games
- Simply choose the game you think has more players using Discord UI buttons
- Games can be selected from several filters: popular games, highest rated games, popular new releases, or steamâ€™s default search list.
- Your score streak is tracked
- Data is scrapped from [Steam Charts](https://steamcharts.com/)

## Lore
Steam Charts Game was inspired in part by the classic browser game [Higher or Lower](http://www.higherlowergame.com/) - but with Steam games instead of Google searches.
It was also inspired by my buddy Joey constantly telling me that TF2 is a dead game despite it consistently being in the most played games on Steam.
